    #class_uri: CHMO:0000613
    description: Spectroscopy where the energy states of spin-active nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them.

      - This class serves as an example for the way in which we want to build domain specific schema profiles. It will be outsourced to a more appropriate location in the future.
